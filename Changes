0.044   2022-08-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - Add functions:
          contains_{brace,joker,class,qmark,glob,globstar}_wildcard.

        - [function convert_wildcard_to_re] Add options: globstar,
          path_separator.

        - Better compliance with bash: joker/glob does not match across
          subdirectory level, e.g. '*' matches 'aaa' but not 'aaa/bbb'.

        - [bugfix] Fix parameter passed to recursive
          convert_wildcard_to_re().
